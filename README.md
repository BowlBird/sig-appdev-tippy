# sig-appdev-tippy
An example project to check your work!


#### What I want from you
Only use this repo if you are stuck! It's best to learn by just trying to get through this.

I want you to make a tip calculator app that
 - Accepts user input through the numerical keyboard (KeyboardType.Decimal)
 - Has a slider that allows you to select tip percentage
 - Displays the tip percentage & final amount
   - The final amount should be formatted as USD Currency
 - Use ViewModels & StateFlows to access state
 - One extra fun feature!
